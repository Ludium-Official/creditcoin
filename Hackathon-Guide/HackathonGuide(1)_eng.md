### **0. What is a Hackathon?**

![Main](/Hackathon-Guide//Images/Main.png)

A hackathon (Hackathon = Hacking + Marathon) is an event where teams of developers, designers, and planners come together to turn ideas into prototypes or complete products within a limited amount of time.

The purpose of a hackathon is to foster innovation and present new ideas or solutions.

Participants join hackathons for various reasons—for example, to win prizes, build networks with peers, or gain experience.

Companies leverage hackathons to encourage contributions to open-source projects, expand ecosystems, or even as a means of talent recruitment.

Each hackathon has its own unique format and theme depending on the organizer and industry focus.

> **💡 Key Tip: Identifying these unique characteristics and tailoring your strategy accordingly is often the key to winning a hackathon.**

Organizers typically disclose everything participants need to know: challenges, timelines, participation rules, rewards, objectives, mentors, judges, FAQs, and communication channels.

> **💡 Key Tip: Carefully analyze all this information and choose the hackathon that best fits your tech stack, interests, and goals—this is the first step to success.**

### **3. Time Management Strategies**

### ⏰ Hackathon Timeline

**Offline Hackathon (24–48h)**

- Day 1 (0–4h): Topic selection & planning
- Day 1 (4–8h): Role assignment & environment setup
- Day 1 (8–16h): Core feature development
- Day 2 (0–8h): Additional features & UI development
- Day 2 (8–12h): Testing & debugging
- Day 2 (12–16h): Pitch prep & presentation

**Online Hackathon (1–4 weeks)**

- Week 1: Refine idea & choose tech stack
- Week 2: Core feature development
- Week 3: UI/UX improvements & testing
- Week 4: Optimization & pitch preparation

### ⏱️ Time Management Tips

**❗️ First 2 hours are critical**

- **Decide chain & tech stack** (most important!)
- Team building & brainstorming
- **Contract architecture design**
- Finish role assignment

**⛳️ Optimize development time**

- **Build smart contracts first** (takes the longest)
- **Gas optimization later** (after core features)
- Focus on MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- Completion over perfection
- **Continuous testnet deployment & testing**

**🗣️ Presentation prep**

- **Live demo required** (real transaction)
- Start pitch prep at least 2 hours before deadline
- Rehearse demo scenarios
- Prepare answers for likely questions

  - [Taikai Network](https://taikai.network/hackathons): Search hackathons → click those tagged “Finished” → check “Results” tab ([Example](https://taikai.network/ethrome/hackathons/ethrome-24/results))

- Key analysis points:
  - Tech stack & architecture of winners
  - Project types preferred by foundations
  - Track-specific winning patterns
  - Judging criteria & evaluation factors

**📊 Track global trends**
